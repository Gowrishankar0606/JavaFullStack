Types of Tags

Container 

Container tags are generally divided into three parts, i.e., opening tag, content(which will display on the browser), and closing tag. 
In the content part, they can also contain some other tags. 
These opening and closing tags are used in pairs which are start tag and end tag, which are often called ON and OFF tags.

Examples: 

<head> </head>
<Header></header>
<nav></nav>
<p></p>
<h1></h1>

Empty

The tags that do not contain any closing tags are known as empty tags. Empty tags contain only the opening tag but they perform some action in the webpage.
<br>
<hr>
<img>
<input>
	
INLINE and BLOCK Elements

HTML Block elements, are used to structure the main content of a webpage. 
They typically start on a new line and take up the full width of their container 

Examples: <div>, <p>, <h1> to <h6>, and <ul>, etc.

An inline element does not start on a new line.
An inline element only takes up as much width as necessary.
Inline elements are used within block-level elements to style or format specific parts of the content.

Example:<a> <button> <abbr> <small> <sub> <sup> etc...
